# R-Portfolio-Projects

This repository contains my portfolio projects in R. I am learning general data analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning in R. Both knitted PDF files and .rmd files will be available for the projects.

Bootstrapping VaR Simulation - Using bootstrapping to resample historical returns, I calculated VaR and other performance metrics for 3 different ETF based portfolios. I compared and contrasted each one, weighing the positives and negatives. With the simulations, I was able to identify the best option for my risk tolerance and investing goals. 

Titanic NYC Flights Analysis - Practice using data visualization and data wrangling techniques in R (tidyverse, ggplot). 

Auto mpg Linear Regression - Using linear regression to model relationships between car features and mpg. Iterative process includes studying feature interactions, variable transformation, and diagnostic plots.
